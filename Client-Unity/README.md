# MP title

Part 1 is a Grapher in Unity 

Part 2 is modules for physics

Everything is oriented to help students taking courses in math and physics 

## Controls

* Movement w,a,s,d
* Right click rotates x axis
* Left click rotates y axis
* "C" changes the camera 

## How to write the expressions

* Numbers
	* Accepts Ints and doubles
	
* Constants
	* Pi

		`(pi)`
	
	* Euler's number

		`
	(e)
	`

* Trigonometric functions
	* sin
		`sen`
	* sinh
		`senh`
	* arcsin
		`arcsen`
	* arcsinh
		`arcsenh`
	* cos
		`cos`
	* cosh
		`cosh`
	* arccos
		`arccos`
	* arccosh
		`arccosh`
	* tan
		`tan`
	* tanh
		`tanh`
	* arctan
		`arctan`
	* arctanh
		`arctanh`
	
			All this functions are written in the same format: function()
		
			sen(2)

* Logarithms
	* Logarithm with base different than 10
		
			log base (number) 
		
			log 2 (3)
		
	* Logarithm with base 10

			log (number)
	
	* Natural Logarithm

			ln (number)
	
* Operators
	* \+ , - , /, *, %
	
			sen (2) + log(3)
		
	* Power

			x^2
	
	* Handles Implicit multiplication 
			
			2x

* Expressions
	
		This are required to be in the form (expresion) = 0 and written as (expression)

		sen (2) + log(3) - x
